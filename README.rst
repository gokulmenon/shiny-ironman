Installation of Dependencies
=============================

Since you need to upload your dependencies to GAE along with your project,
you need to install them to the project folder. **requirements.sh** in
the project root directory will install requirments to **libs** directory.
Create symlinks from **libs** directory to the project directory
in order to upload your libraries with your GAE project.

Depending on where you are installing dependencies::

    $ ./requirements.sh


*note: We install production requirements this way because many Platforms as a
Services expect a requirements.txt file in the root of projects.*

Google Cloud Platform
=====================

You need Google Cloud SQL and Google Cloud Storage to run Django code as-is on Google App Engine.

Google Cloud SQL
